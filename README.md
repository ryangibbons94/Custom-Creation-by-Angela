## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, LESS, CSS, JavaScript

## Optimizations
If I had time I would add image modals to pop up when a user clicked an image to highlight the custom creations.

## Challenges Faced/Lessons Learned:

1. Image compression:

Always make sure to select the option to maintain image quality when you are compressing your images.
